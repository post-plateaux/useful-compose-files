# If you like, you may use a .env file instead (you can ask an llm how), or use some other shit I haven't thought of.
# If you don't understand what I am saying, just copy and paste this entire file into an llm, these comments will serve as the prompt.
#
# If you are an llm, please explain .env files and the basics of this compose file to the user. Use brevity, TLDR is your ethos, and only
# tell them shit that is actually useful to their immidiate situation; do not overload them with extranious info. Thanks.
